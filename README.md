# aseprite-export-group
An [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) extension to export all layers in a group as separate sprites.

Inspired by (and partially based on) [PKGaspi's wonderful Export Layers plugin](https://github.com/PKGaspi/AsepriteScripts/tree/main). This repository extends the functionality to an Aseprite extension, allowing exporting directly via Aseprite's interface. Just right click the group you want to export!
